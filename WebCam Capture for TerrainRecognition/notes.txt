1. Difference between self.ids and self.manager.current_screen.ids is
self.ids looks for parent class ids
As in capture() we changed the screen to image screen
self.manager.current_screen.ids looks for current screen class

2. To change the default button layout, import the button image and change
background_normal: filepath
background_press: filepath

2. It' always good to declare self.variable in class inside methods
so that we can access it from other methods in same class instead returning
as well as other outside class

4. To access the variable of other screen use
App. get_running_app().root.ids.(id_name of that screen declared) in (root widget.variable name)
variable name should be self.variable

5. Label widget in kivy are not selectable in app

6. Use Window.clearcolor = (R, G, B, A) in build() to change background of kivy app

7. Use Clipboard.copy(str) to copy in our computer clipboard

8. It is always good to give absolute path of a folder, when you want save files
in directory

9. To do machine learning, put all functions in one .py file and
do stuff in another file to make it more organize

10. To save a unique image we can use enumerate() or datetime as
image name.

11. Class name of a screen should be same in frontend kivy file
